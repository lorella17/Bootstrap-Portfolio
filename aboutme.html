        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img src="images/IMG_2137.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

        <p>Born and raised in a small town where roads remain unpaved in Guatemala.  My mothe migrated to the U.S when i was 5
            leaving me behind with my grandma in search of the american dream.  Saw my mother again at the age of 10 when she
            finally received residency status for her and myself.  Moved to the U.S in 1995, lived in Los Angeles 2 and half years
            prior to moving to Atlanta.  Became the first member of my extended family to graduate from a University.
            Pay for my education working at a local logistics company, where i have reached my peak and looking for a new challege
            that will take my career to the next level.</p>
        <p>Attended and graduated from The Univesity of Georgia in 2008 with B.B.A in Management.  Since 2003 while in High School i have been
            in the transportation industry.  While i have worked with International and for companies outside of Atlanta most of my
            experience has been with Courier Connection inc.  In seeking better and more rewarding opportunities i decided to explore
            a new industry.  An industry that is challenging, competitive and rewarding leading me to the GT bootcamp.  I am excited
            for what my future holds and feel confident my hard work will lead to a successful career.

            **Fluent in Spanish-native speaker**
